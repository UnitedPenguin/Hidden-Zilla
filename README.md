# Hidden Zilla

Hidden Zilla is a simple Firefox extension that enables users to switch their browser's user agent between Firefox's default and Chrome's user agent. This can be helpful in instances where specific websites behave differently depending on the browser used to access them.

# Features

    User friendly: Simply press a button to switch the user agent.
    Switches between Firefox's default user agent and Chrome's user agent.

# How to Install

Since this extension is not published on the Firefox Add-ons Marketplace, you'll need to install it manually:

    Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
    Open Firefox and type about:debugging in the URL bar.
    Navigate to "This Firefox".
    Click on "Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦".
    Open the Hidden Zilla.json file.

# How to Use

# After installing the extension, you'll see a new icon (represented by icon.png) in your Firefox toolbar.

    To switch your user agent to Chrome's, click the icon and press the "Turn On" button.
    To switch your user agent back to Firefox's default, click the icon and press the "Turn Off" button.

Please note that currently, the extension does not restore Firefox's exact default user agent string when you press "Turn Off". It simply stops modifying the user agent.
